# Green Gills: Data Tracking System for Aquaponics Farm Owners

## Motivation
In the demanding environemnt of farm life, owners often face the challenge of managing the health of their numerous fish ponds.
Each tank may contain hundreds of fish, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a healthy environemnt.
Additionally, farm owners have to constantly check the status of their tanks as there is no automated way to know if their tanks are failing.

## Solution
While there are existing systems that gather data from sensors, they often lack the ability to personalize data output.
This project aims to fill that gap by measuring several key parameters such as temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), pressure and pH.
We have also implemented a camera module that displays live footage, allowing the user to view the ponds at any time.
If any of these parameters cross a certain threshold, the system sends SMS notifications to alert the user.
Furthermore, a website is available for owners to check the status of their tanks at any time. 
This system provides an all-in-one solution tailored to the needs of aquaponics farmers, enabling real-time monitoring of pond health from home.
